# How to Activate Adobe Photoshop with a Redemption Code or a Serial Number
 
If you purchased Adobe Photoshop from a retailer, reseller, or received it as a gift card, you will need to redeem a redemption code to start using your product. A redemption code is a 24-digit alphanumeric code that you can find under the silver scratch-off label on product cards, on an insert in a boxed product, or included in the body of an email if you did not purchase a physical product[^1^]. Depending on how you purchased your product, you may also need a serial number to activate it. A serial number is a 24-digit numeric code that you can find on the disc sleeve or on the product box[^3^]. Here are the steps to activate Adobe Photoshop with a redemption code or a serial number.
